Assuming you have already downloaded CRF++ and Python3 (or higher):

- In your console go to the main directory where learn_with_crf.py is located.
- Type 'python3 learn_with_crf.py config.cfg'

The configuration file 'config.cfg' includes the configuration of the preprocessing module and the CRF++ interface. 
If you want to change the configuration then open this file and put the settings you want.

Please report any bugs or comments to:
